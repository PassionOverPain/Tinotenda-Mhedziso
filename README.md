Feel free to review my portfolio project and clone as you wish.
Please do not copy me to "make it your own" rather take inspiration and turn it into something that reflects YOU.
Once you are done reviewing, you can send me feedback either through Passion (<u>my chatbot</u>) or opening a GitHub issue. I am open to all ideas.😎 
I am  also <b>open to collaborate</b> on your own personal portfolio, let me know through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinotenda-mhedziso/) or leave a GitHub issue.
